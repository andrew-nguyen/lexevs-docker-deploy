# LexEVS Dockerization Project

This repository provides configuration files for the containerized distribution and automated deployment of LexEVS using Docker. Pre-built, version-tagged images published to the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com#fixme) are intended for both development and production use. In typical Docker fashion, environment-specific configuration parameters are provided at runtime via environment variables. Containers also conform to the [service packaging requirements](https://healthservices.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PE/Service+Packaging+Requirements) of [HSPC](http://hspconsortium.org) for future distribution and automated deployment via the HSPC Marketplace.
