# LexEVS Dockerization Project

This repository provides configuration files for the containerized distribution and automated deployment of LexEVS using Docker. Pre-built, version-tagged images published to the NCI's Docker hub are intended for both development and production use. In typical Docker fashion, environment-specific configuration parameters are provided at runtime via environment variables.
